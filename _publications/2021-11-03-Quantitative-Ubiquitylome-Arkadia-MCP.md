## Abstract

RNF111/Arkadia is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway by degrading transcriptional repressors SKIL/SnoN and SKI. Truncations of the RING C-terminal domain of RNF111 that abolish its E3 function and subsequently activate TGF-β signaling are observed in some cancers. In the present study, we sought to perform a comprehensive analysis of RNF111 endogenous substrates upon TGF-β signaling activation using an integrative proteomic approach. In that aim, we carried out label-free quantitative proteomics after the enrichment of ubiquitylated proteins (ubiquitylome) in parental U2OS cell line compared with U2OS CRISPR engineered clones expressing a truncated form of RNF111 devoid of its C-terminal RING domain. We compared two methods of enrichment for ubiquitylated proteins before proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry, the diGlycine (diGly) remnant peptide immunoprecipitation with a K-ε-GG antibody, and a novel approach using protein immunoprecipitation with a ubiquitin pan nanobody that recognizes all ubiquitin chains and monoubiquitylation. Although we detected SKIL ubiquitylation among 108 potential RNF111 substrates with the diGly method, we found that the ubiquitin pan nanobody method also constitutes a powerful approach because it enabled the detection of 52 potential RNF111 substrates including SKI, SKIL, and RNF111. Integrative comparison of the RNF111-dependent proteome and ubiquitylomes enabled the identification of SKI and SKIL as the only targets ubiquitylated and degraded by RNF111 E3 ligase function in the presence of TGF-β. Our results indicate that lysine 343 localized in the SAND domain of SKIL constitutes a target for RNF111 ubiquitylation and demonstrate that RNF111 E3 ubiquitin ligase function specifically targets SKI and SKIL ubiquitylation and degradation upon TGF-β pathway activation.
