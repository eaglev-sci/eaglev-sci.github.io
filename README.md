# Personal Website

This repo is used to build my personal website, following the template from Academic Pages, available [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.

The configuration of the website is still in progress, I initialized only a few pages at the moment.
