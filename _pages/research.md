## Interests

For a while now, I have had a strong interest in Structural Biology and the study of proteins, how they fold, what their 3D-structure can tell or how it regulates their interactions with other molecules, whether they are other proteins, RNA, DNA or smaller ligands.


Deep Learning has revolutionized Structural Biology in the recent years and I definitely intend to exploit AI capabilities to study proteins further and satisfy my curiosity. I am even more excited about the possibilities offered by the field of Protein Design, which offers to expand the protein space and create new proteins with original biological functions (think enzymatic functions for plastic degradation for instance, or assembly of protein-based nanomaterials, peptide or full protein development for new biologics or vaccines). The first step for me will be to get a better understanding of how a protein's structure influences its interactions through the study of the information contained in the structure, and to manage to extract the relevant information from the 3D features of these macromolecules.

I am also quite intrigued by the networks formed by proteins, how these networks and pathways dictate what is going on in our cells, and how everything is well balanced; that is, until a perturbation occurs and propagates to induce the multiple pathologies we face. 

## Projects

### Homologuous proteins mining



protein subdomains, binding pockets or motifs


### Omics analysis of Cystic Fibrosis conditions

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting the respiratory and digestive systems, caracterized by symptoms such as respiratory difficulties or chronic inflammation and leading to reduced life expectancy. It affects about 1/3000 people in the Caucasian population. The disease is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), with around 2000 mutations known to date. The most prevalent mutation, present in ~70% of patients, is the F508del mutation, which disturbs the folding of the CFTR protein and its transport to the membrane of the epithelial cells. 



## Previous experiences

Prior to starting my PhD I have also worked three years as a Research Engineer on the [CurieCoreTech Mass Spectrometry Proteomics](https://institut-curie.org/plateforme/curiecoretech-mass-spectrometry-proteomics) facility of Institut Curie.
