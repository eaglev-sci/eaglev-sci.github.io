My name is Victor Laigle, I'm a 1st year PhD student in computational biology / bioinformatics at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), in the [CBIO - Centre for Computational Biology](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) team. I am co-supervised by [VÃ©ronique Stoven](https://curie.fr/personne/veronique-stoven) and [Vincent Mallet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSlWpRUAAAAJ).

My current interests are focused on proteins, their structural properties and how they interact with each other or with different ligands. I am especially curious about how it will be possible to use this understanding in the development of new drugs or even new proteins with yet inexistant biological functions. In these purposes, I definitely intend to exploit the new possibilities brought by the Deep Learning revolution in Structural Biology.

I am also quite intrigued by the networks formed by proteins, how these networks and pathways dictate what is going on in our cells, and how everything is well balanced; that is, until a perturbation occurs and propagates to induce the multiple pathologies we face. 

<!-- I describe my research interests more in depth on [this page](/research/). -->

Outside of the lab I enjoy hitting the ball on a volleyball court or on the sand when the sun shines, exploring landscapes filled with beautiful waters or icy formations, debating about anything and laughing with friends about the little ironies of life.

## PhD project

My PhD revolves around two main subjects:

### Geometric Deep Learning for Protein representations

As proteins are the building blocks of life, their properties, interactions and functions are of particular importance. Understanding and predicting those would unlock a whole panoply of applications, 

Since the AlphaFold breakthrough, protein structures are available for almost any protein known, which allows us to use 3D features such as atom coordinates or protein surface information to train Geometric Deep Learning algorithms. We 

### Systems Biology approaches for the discovery of new therapeutic targets in Cystic Fibrosis

Using omics analysis methods combined with systems biology approaches, we intend to build a network of proteins that caracterizes the cascade of dysregulations in Cystic Fibrosis. Through the analysis of this network, we hope to identify potential therapeutic targets, other than CFTR (mutated protein in Cystic Fibrosis), to allow the development of treatments for patients whose CFTR protein is "unrescuable". <!-- See [here](/research/) for more details. -->
