My name is Victor Laigle, I'm a 1st year PhD student in computational biology / bioinformatics at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), in the [CBIO - Centre for Computational Biology](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) team. I am co-supervised by [VÃ©ronique Stoven](https://curie.fr/personne/veronique-stoven) and [Vincent Mallet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSlWpRUAAAAJ).

My current interests are focused on proteins, their structural properties, how they interact with each other or with other ligands.

Outside of the lab I enjoy plenty of things but mostly playing volleyball or beach volley when the sun shines, traveling and hiking through spectacular landscapes, learning about new stuff or just debating about anything. 


## PhD project

My PhD revolves around two main subjects:

### Geometric Deep Learning for Protein representations



### Systems Biology approaches for the discovery of new therapeutic targets in Cystic Fibrosis



## Previous experiences

Prior to starting my PhD I have also worked three years as a Research Engineer on the [CurieCoreTech Mass Spectrometry Proteomics](https://institut-curie.org/plateforme/curiecoretech-mass-spectrometry-proteomics) facility of Institut Curie.
